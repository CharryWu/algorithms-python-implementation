"""
The heapsort algorithm starts by using BUILD-MAX-HEAP to build a max-heap
on the input array A. Since the maximum element of the array is stored at the root A[0],
we can put it into its correct final position by exchanging it with A[n-1].
If we now discard node n from the heapâ€”and we
can do so by simply decrementing A.heap-size. We observe that the children of
the root remain max-heaps, but the new root element might violate the max-heap
property. All we need to do to restore the max-heap property, however, is call
MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 0), which leaves a max-heap in A[:n-1]. The heapsort
algorithm then repeats this process for the max-heap of size n-1 down to a heap
of size 2.
